Four popular methods for writing modular HTML and CSS.
<ol>
  <li>
    Object Oriented CSS (OOCSS)

    <h2>Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS (SMACSS)</h2>
    <p>
      The five categories it defines are: Base, Layout, Module, State and Theme.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Base</h3>
        <p>
          Base rules are applied directly to element selectors, descendant selectors and pseudo selectors.
          These wouldn’t be applied to classes or IDs as they’re default CSS rules. Resets are a good example.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Layout</h3>
        <p>
          Layout rules are for the major components of a site like the header, footer, sidebar, or main- content.
          These will often have CSS applied to an ID like #sidebar or #header. Classes can also be used.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Modules</h3>
        <p>
          Minor layout components are considered as modules and typically live inside the major layout components.
          A content box inside a sidebar is an example. Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between major and minor components.
          The more a component is repeated, the more likely it’s a module. Navigation bars and widgets are good examples of modules.
          Here, we want to stick to classes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>State</h3>
        <p>
          State rules apply to changes like hovering over a navigation item or collapsing and expanding an accordion menu.
          State rules are similar to modules, but differ in several ways.
          They can apply to both layout and module styles and often indicate a JavaScript dependency.
          More importantly, they apply to changes that occur after the page is rendered. Like modules,
          they should be developed to stand alone with styles being inside a single class selector.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Theme</h3>
        <p>
          Theme rules are typically used least on a single project and aren’t considered one of the core categories.
          These define things like colour and typography, and exist so user preferences can overwrite any of the above rules.
        </p>
      </li>

    </ul>
    <p>Another important concept to SMACSS is its naming convention. As Snook mentions, “a naming convention is beneficial for immediately understanding which category a particular style belongs to and its role within the overall scope of the page.”

The following convention is suggested for each of the four core categories:

Base Nothing needed
Layout l- or layout- prefix
State is- prefix, as in is-active or is-hidden. When
applied to a module, you should include the
module name as in .is-tab-active
Module Modules just use module name (.box)
instead of trying to prefix each. However, related modules (submodules) receive a consistent prefix to help organise them (.box-border, .box-background, etc)</p>

  <li> Block, Element, Modifier (BEM)</li>
  
</ol>
