# Install
In linux terminal
`sudo apt-get install vim`

# Use vim
Let file name if `foo` that we want to edit using vim editor
- go to foo file directory and write `vim foo`

# Hit the `Esc` key; that goes into command mode. Then you can type
- `:q` to quit (short for `:quit`)
- `:q!` to quit without saving (short for `:quit!`)
- `:wq` to write and quit (think write and quit)
- `:wq!` to write and quit even if file has only read permission (if file does not have write permission: force write)
- `:x` to write and quit (shorter than `:wq`)
- `:qa` to quit all (short for `:quitall`)
