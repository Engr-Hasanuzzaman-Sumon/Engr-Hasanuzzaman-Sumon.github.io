        In Ruby if you use symbolize key to keep data to hash you also have to use symbolize key to access and this
        is true for string.
        
        {% highlight ruby %}
            foo = {}
            foo[:key1] = 'symbolize key1'
            foo['key2'] = 'string key2'

            p foo[:key1] # symbolize key1
            p foo['key2'] # string key2

            p foo['key1'] # nil because there is no key named 'key1' ('key1' == :key1 return false)
            p foo[:key2] # nil because there is no key named :key2 ('key2' == :key2 return false)

            # but in rails we can access
        {% endhighlight %}
        
        But in rails we can use symbol and string alternatively for hash key because it use <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActiveSupport/HashWithIndifferentAccess">HashWithIndifferentAccess</a>
        instead ruby hash where internally all key converted to string.
