<b>Ghost Methods</b>
<p>
  From the caller’s side, a message that’s processed by method_missing looks like
a regular call—but on the receiver’s side, it has no corresponding method.
This trick is called a Ghost Method.
</p>
<b>Dynamic Proxies</b>
<p>
  When an object(wrapper object that contain other object) receive ghost method call and simply use that call to
  get data from contained object is called Dynamic Proxies.
</p>

<P>
  Every time we override method_missing(for use ghost method) we should also override respond_to_missing?
  Because ghost method call on respond_to? will not respond.
</P>
<b>module const_missing method</b>
<p>
  When you reference a constant that doesn’t exist, Ruby passes the name of
the constant to const_missing as a symbol. Class names are just constants
</p>
<p>N.B: When we use ghost method need to extra carefull because it may cause infinity call</p>
<ul>There are exactly three places where a program leaves the previous scope
behind and opens a new one:
  <li>Class definitions</li>
  <li>Class definitions</li>
  <li>Class definitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Ruby class is not special thing it just give us new scope</p>
<b>Solve Rubymine keyboard freez problem</b>
Keyboard input may be unlocked by restarting IBus daemon from a console:

<code>ibus-daemon -rd</code>
IBus can be disabled for IDEA by unsetting env. variable XMODIFIERS, but ability to input national characters in IDEA will be lost:

<code>XMODIFIERS="" idea.sh</code>
I have used the second one and fixed my problem.

<p>@indicate inctace objecct of self. If during declaretoin of @var self is class then it class es instace objeect, if 
self indicate obje then it object's instance variable.</p>

<p>Like other programming language, ruby instance variable is not open to out side world(class).{In java public inctance 
variable is accessabe using dot(.) operator outside of class}So, to access variable we have to declare getter/setter method
in ruby.(There are many way to access variable in ruby like instace_variable_get, instacnce_eval, eval</p>
<p>We can make flat scope for sharing local variable between two or more methods</p>
