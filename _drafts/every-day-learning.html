<b>Ghost Methods</b>
<p>
  From the caller’s side, a message that’s processed by method_missing looks like
a regular call—but on the receiver’s side, it has no corresponding method.
This trick is called a Ghost Method.
</p>
<b>Dynamic Proxies</b>
<p>
  When an object(wrapper object that contain other object) receive ghost method call and simply use that call to
  get data from contained object is called Dynamic Proxies.
</p>

<P>
  Every time we override method_missing(for use ghost method) we should also override respond_to_missing?
  Because ghost method call on respond_to? will not respond.
</P>
<b>module const_missing method</b>
<p>
  When you reference a constant that doesn’t exist, Ruby passes the name of
the constant to const_missing as a symbol. Class names are just constants
</p>
<p>N.B: When we use ghost method need to extra carefull because it may cause infinity call</p>
<ul>There are exactly three places where a program leaves the previous scope
behind and opens a new one:
  <li>Class definitions</li>
  <li>Class definitions</li>
  <li>Class definitions</li>
</ul>
<p>Ruby class is not special thing it just give us new scope</p>
